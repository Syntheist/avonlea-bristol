# Avonlea

A tranquil ambient visual scene for norns, inspired by the Lake of Shining Waters.

> "the Lake of Shining Waters was blue — blue — blue;  
> not the changeful blue of spring, nor the pale azure of summer,  
> but a clear, steadfast, serene blue,  
> as if the water were past all modes and tenses of emotion  
> and had settled down to a tranquillity unbroken by fickle dreams."

Avonlea creates a peaceful ambient visual scene showing stars, distant trees, hills, and reeds swaying by the lake shore.

**Note**: This version is currently visual-only. Sound engine implementation is under development.
