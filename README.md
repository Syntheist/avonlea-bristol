_A tranquil ambient sketch for norns._  
Inspired by the Lake of Shining Waters in **Anne of Green Gables**.

## Concept

Avonlea captures the stillness of a night lake,  
where moonlight and weather drift softly from  
Prince Edward Island into a quiet, glowing box.

## Features

- Moon and weather shape tone and light
- Glints, stars, and reeds respond to wind
- Calm invites soft melody; storms quiet it
- Shooting stars cross clear skies
