![cover](cover.png)

_A tranquil ambient sketch for norns._  
Inspired by the Lake of Shining Waters in **Anne of Green Gables**.

## Concept

Avonlea captures the stillness of a night lake,  
where moonlight and weather drift softly from  
Prince Edward Island into a quiet, glowing box.

---

## Features

- Moon and weather shape tone and light
- Glints, stars, and reeds respond to wind
- Calm invites soft melody; storms quiet it
- Shooting stars cross clear skies

---

## Controls

- **E1**: Wind
- **E2**: Depth
- **E3**: Glint
- **K2**: Cycle weather
- **K3**: Refresh sky
