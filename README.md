# Avonlea

_A tranquil ambient sketch for norns._  
Inspired by the Lake of Shining Waters in **Anne of Green Gables**.

> “…as if the water were past all modes and tenses of emotion…”

## Concept

Avonlea is a quiet sandbox that portrays the night over a lake,  
as seen from Prince Edward Island. The sky and water respond  
to live weather and the moon’s motion, crafting a soundscape that  
moves with the world.

## Atmosphere

- Moon phase and angle shape the shimmer and tone
- Open-Meteo provides real-world weather (daily update)
- Stars fade when clouds appear; glints dim with rain
- Wind bends reeds; snow softens the edges of sound
